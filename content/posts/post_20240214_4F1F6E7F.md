You might be thinking that this post is about me doing a breakdown on how Tpain dominated the 2000s with major hits and I should adopt his mindset

If you aren't familar with one some of his song here it one.

The bartender mindset, in my terms, is how a developer/programmer, when on-call, should keep his responsibilities tidy, like

- Clean up backlog
- Validate service dashboards
- Respond to service desk tickets
- Clean up VCS(Version control system) tickets
- Update documentation
- Gather previous on-call activities
- Generate a report for the next on-call member

Similar to how a bartender does the following

- Checks bar inventory levels
- Checks up on customers
- Wipes down surfaces
- Closes out tabs
- Preps items before opening
- Preps items for the next person on the shift

Adopting this bartender mindset, ensures we adopt a [kaizen way](https://www.techtarget.com/searcherp/definition/kaizen-or-continuous-improvement) and tackles these issues I've seen across teams

- Technical debt
- Frustated customers due to the timely manner of how issues have been solved
- Time to tackle on new issues
