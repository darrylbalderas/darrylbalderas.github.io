You might be thinking that this post is about me doing a breakdown on how Tpain and Akon bodied this song and major banger in early 2000's.

If you aren't familar with the song here it is.

The bartender mindset in my terms is how a developer/programer when on-call should be thinking about prepping for next round of customers

- Clean up backlog
- Validate service dashboards
- Reponse to service desk tickets
- Clean up old PRs
- Update documentation
- Gather previous on-call activites
- Generate a report for next on-call member


Similar to how a bartender does the following

- checks inventory levels
- greets customers
- checks up on customers
- wipes down surfaces
- closes out tabs
- preps items before opening
- preps items for the next person on the shift
