# Problem Statement

As of today I have 3 year old dog that suffers from separation anxiety. We have tried various techniques to reduce the
anxiety but have had no luck. From trainers, toys, and exercise we faced the same outcome of not being able to leave
my dog for more than 10 minutes without her howling and pacing.

# Motivation

To solve this issue I want to combine of what I have been doing with a more data centric approach. I would like to see what works and what
does work for my dog. Instead of applying a one size fit all solution let's get a bit more personalized. In a nutshell, I will be capturing videos
and processing the videos to collect the following metrics;

- Date and time of training
- Pacing between two points
- Number of Howls

# Diagram

![image alt text](/doggy-cam-diagram.png)

1. Run a script to capture video from my laptop
2. Run a script to process video to reduce the size
3. Run a script to run hugging face model on reduce size video
4. Upload predictions to s3
5. Upload reduce and compressed video to s3 to future storage
