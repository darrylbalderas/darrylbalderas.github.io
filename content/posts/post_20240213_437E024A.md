GRPC has been a subject of API development that I wanted to explore more, but I needed more time.

## Motivation

I wanted to jump into GRPC using Python, my language of comfort, to set up a sample project to go through the setup exercises of all the GRPC parts.
For quickly getting up a modern HTTP API server, I use [Fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and for more season APIs, I use [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
I don't have that for GRPC. The primary purpose of this post is to showcase setting up a simple GRPC that I can build on for future applications.

## Repository

<https://github.com/darrylbalderas/helloworld-python-grpc>

## Steps

Here is the [site](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/quickstart/) that I used to get started with my first GRPC project

1. Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. It should install `grpc` and `grpcio-tools` dependencies so that we can get started with running GRPC server
1. Copy [grpc client example](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/examples/python/helloworld/greeter_client.py) to `greeter_client.py` file
1. Copy [grpc server example](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/examples/python/helloworld/greeter_server.py) to `greeter_server.py` file
1. Copy [grpc hello proto example](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/examples/protos/helloworld.proto) into `protos` folder
1. Run this command to generate python grpc code `python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I protos/ --python_out=./protos --pyi_out=./protos --grpc_python_out=./protos protos/helloworld.proto`
1. Modiy import statements in `greeter_server.py,` `greeter_client.py`, and `protos/helloworld_pb2_grpc.py` to point to the correct Python proto buff generated code. For example;

    {{< highlight go-html-template "lineNos=inline, lineNoStart=21" >}}
    import helloworld_pb2 as helloworld_pb2
    import helloworld_pb2_grpc as helloworld_pb2_grpc
    {{< /highlight >}}

    **Update to**

    {{< highlight go-html-template "lineNos=inline, lineNoStart=21" >}}
    import protos.helloworld_pb2 as helloworld_pb2
    import protos.helloworld_pb2_grpc as helloworld_pb2_grpc
    {{< /highlight >}}

1. Run server `python greeter_server.py`
1. Run client `python greeter_client.py`

## Expected output

The Client should submit a request to the Server to `SayHello`.

### Client output

```bash
$: python greeter_client.py
Will try to greet world ...
Greeter client received: Hello, you!
```

### Server output

```bash
$: python greeter_server.py
Server started, listening on 50051
```

## Learnings

Quickly doing this small project showed me the capabilities of how GRPC can scale and solve problems that HTTP can
struggles like

- Handshake problem.
- Streaming data
- Agreeable data contract between the Client and Server
