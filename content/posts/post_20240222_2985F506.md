I am currently delving into Golang libraries, and I must say, the depth and breadth of resources available are impressive. Many of my needs can be met directly within these libraries. For instance, creating a basic server is straightforward, and the scalability options are robust. Today, I'm particularly intrigued by an external framework called GIN, which has garnered a lot of attention from developers. I'm eager to explore it firsthand to understand the rationale behind its creation and how it improves upon the native Golang net/http module.
