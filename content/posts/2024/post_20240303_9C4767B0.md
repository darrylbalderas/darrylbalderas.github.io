## Motivation

First, if you played the first generation of Pokemon, you know who and what Magikarp is. Magikarp is a water-type Pokemon that only knows one move until it evolves. Real Pokemon trainers see the struggle of leveling up Magikarp, but the reward is worth it once it transforms. You end up with a lovely Gyarados. A comparison of the two is below.

This post is not to nerd out about Pokemon but to talk about a cluster autoscaling tool called `karpenter`. Cluster autoscaling is a method where you have a set of processes to monitor your existing and requested workloads and scale up and down to meet your demands and adhere to your budget limits. Cluster autoscaling, in general, is similar to how it is to train a Magikarp, where you struggle to tune and set it up in the beginning, but the benefits of getting your Gyarados are worth it in the end. `Karpenter` comes equipped as a Gyarado, ready to rumble and tumble to help you become the best Pokemon trainer and prepared to catch them all.

Here is pokemon theme song for the memorires for all my pokemon fans out there.

Let me show you a quick example on how easy to get started

## Prequisties

- [AWS account](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account)
- [AWS Network configuration setu](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/create-vpc.html)p like vpc, subnets, security groups, NACLS, interfaces, etc..
- [EKS cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/clusters.html) to deploy Karpenter
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

If you are familar with terraform I do have terraform modules that are not public that you can use as referce to create some of the prequisties

- [AWS network configuration](https://github.com/darrylbalderas/magic-karp/tree/main/modules/networking) Create a simple VPC with public, private and infra subnets
- [EKS](https://github.com/darrylbalderas/magic-karp/tree/main/modules/eks) Creates a two node eks managed node group cluster

## Steps

1. Login into your EKS cluster `aws eks --region <<EKS_CLUSTER_REGION>> update-kubeconfig --name <<CLUSTER_NAME>>`
2. Install karpenter with helm `https://karpenter.sh/docs/getting-started/getting-started-with-karpenter/#4-install-karpenter`
3. Create a [karpenter node pool and ec2nodeclass](https://karpenter.sh/docs/getting-started/getting-started-with-karpenter/#5-create-nodepool). Ensure you update `role` to point to the Node IAM role that your kubernetesn nodes are using. Update `tags` to ensure contain your eks cluster name

    ```yaml
    role: "" # replace with your cluster name
    subnetSelectorTerms:
        - tags:
            karpenter.sh/discovery: "${CLUSTER_NAME}" # replace with your cluster name
    ```

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1beta1
    kind: NodePool
    metadata:
    name: default
    spec:
    template:
        spec:
        requirements:
            - key: kubernetes.io/arch
            operator: In
            values: ["amd64"]
            - key: kubernetes.io/os
            operator: In
            values: ["linux"]
            - key: karpenter.sh/capacity-type
            operator: In
            values: ["spot"]
            - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-category
            operator: In
            values: ["c", "m", "r"]
            - key: karpenter.k8s.aws/instance-generation
            operator: Gt
            values: ["2"]
        nodeClassRef:
            name: default
    limits:
        cpu: 1000
    disruption:
        consolidationPolicy: WhenUnderutilized
        expireAfter: 720h # 30 * 24h = 720h
    ---
    apiVersion: karpenter.k8s.aws/v1beta1
    kind: EC2NodeClass
    metadata:
    name: default
    spec:
    amiFamily: AL2 # Amazon Linux 2
    role: "KarpenterNodeRole-${CLUSTER_NAME}" # replace with your cluster name
    subnetSelectorTerms:
        - tags:
            karpenter.sh/discovery: "${CLUSTER_NAME}" # replace with your cluster name
    securityGroupSelectorTerms:
        - tags:
            karpenter.sh/discovery: "${CLUSTER_NAME}" # replace with your cluster name
    ```

4. Create a sample deployment to test out karpenter

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
    name: inflate
    spec:
    replicas: 0
    selector:
        matchLabels:
        app: inflate
    template:
        metadata:
        labels:
            app: inflate
        spec:
        terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 0
        containers:
            - name: inflate
            image: public.ecr.aws/eks-distro/kubernetes/pause:3.7
            resources:
                requests:
                cpu: 1
    ```

5. Scale deployment and watch karpenter logs `kubectl scale deployment inflate --replicas 5 && kubectl logs -f -n "${KARPENTER_NAMESPACE}" -l app.kubernetes.io/name=karpenter -c controller`
6. Watch new nodes compute as well `kubectl get nodes -w`
7. Once you have verified, you can scale down `kubectl delete deployment inflate && kubectl logs -f -n "${KARPENTER_NAMESPACE}" -l app.kubernetes.io/name=karpenter -c controller`
8. Once nodes have scale down, you can delete your cluster. If you created with terraform, `terraform destory` is all you needed.

## Learnings

Karpenter is a powerful tool to know if you are in the AWS ecosystem. I see the potential of having lean clusters without sacrificing scaling. Karpenter can request and provision nodes on the fly. I will use it for personal projects where I pay a fixed price for a small size cluster and deploy applications on spot instances. This cluster will help get additional hands-on experience with Kubernetes and experiment with new EKS features.
