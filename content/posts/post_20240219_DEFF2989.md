As I continue my journey in learning more about golang. I am venturing off to find frameworks that I can use to write better clis or apis. There is a popular framework called Cobra that helps golang developers generate cli applications that can scale. `kubectl`, `hugo`, and `gh` are few of many that are leveraging Cobra.

I do have a [cookiecutter template](https://github.com/darrylbalderas/cookiecutter-golang-cli) that I can use to generate an inital cobra application.
We will use the cookie template to generate `depot` cli application to handle different types of storage like `aws`, `fs`, `gcloud`, and `azure`.

We won't be implementing CRUD operations for each storage type. We will mock out functionality using print statements to demonstrate Cobra's subcommand capabilities.


# Steps

1. My [Cookiecutter blog post](https://darrylbalderas.github.io/posts/post_20240218_2311c46d/) can help with setting up the inital cobra application


2. Once you have setup the cli application you can run these commands to generate subcommands e.g. `go run main.go aws`

    ```
    cobra-cli add aws
    cobra-cli add fs
    cobra-cli add azure
    cobra-cli add gcloud
    ```

    Output if you run `go run main.go -h`

    ```
    ➜  depot git:(main) ✗ go run main.go -h
    A longer description that spans multiple lines and likely contains
    examples and usage of using your application. For example:

    Cobra is a CLI library for Go that empowers applications.
    This application is a tool to generate the needed files
    to quickly create a Cobra application.

    Usage:
    depot [command]

    Available Commands:
    aws         A brief description of your command
    azure       A brief description of your command
    completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
    fs          A brief description of your command
    gcloud      A brief description of your command
    help        Help about any command

    Flags:
    -h, --help     help for depot
    -t, --toggle   Help message for toggle

    Use "depot [command] --help" for more information about a command.
    ```


3. Add these [commands](https://github.com/darrylbalderas/depot/blob/main/cmd/crud.go) into `crud.go` and make sure to register [them](https://github.com/darrylbalderas/depot/blob/main/cmd/aws.go#L28-L31) e.g.

    ```go
    func init() {
        rootCmd.AddCommand(awsCmd)
        awsCmd.AddCommand(CpCmd)
        awsCmd.AddCommand(DeleteCmd)
        awsCmd.AddCommand(ListCmd)
    }
    ```

    Here is the output if you run `go run main.go aws -h`. You should see cp, ls, delete subcommands

    ```bash
    ➜  depot git:(main) ✗ go run main.go aws -h
    A longer description that spans multiple lines and likely contains examples
    and usage of using your command. For example:

    Cobra is a CLI library for Go that empowers applications.
    This application is a tool to generate the needed files
    to quickly create a Cobra application.

    Usage:
    depot aws [flags]
    depot aws [command]

    Available Commands:
    cp          A brief description of your command
    delete      A brief description of your command
    ls          A brief description of your command

    Flags:
    -h, --help   help for aws

    Use "depot aws [command] --help" for more information about a command.
    ```

4. Execute sub-sub commands to verify functionality.

    ```bash
    ➜  depot git:(main) go run main.go aws ls
    cp called
    ➜  depot git:(main) ✗ go run main.go aws ls
    ls called
    ➜  depot git:(main) ✗ go run main.go aws delete
    delete called
    ```


Congrulations, you now have a cobra cli application with various subcommands where you can extend functionality if you would like


# Learnings

With Cobra, I feel it follows a Makefile approach where you can organized your tooling in way that makes logical sense to the user

`APPNAME VERB NOUN --ADJECTIVE`

In combination with the golang programming language where you can generate executables based on the hardware and os, this cli framework lend itself
to generate powerful cli tools.
