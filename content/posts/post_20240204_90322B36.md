# Problem Statement

Early this year, my goal was to build a website to share content to better my technical writing.
Even though a website is a solid idea, it costs money to host. You can reach a targeted audience via social media but ownership and
migrating content is a hassle because that data is meant to stay on the platform. I am looking to create a simple website where
I can quickly blog, pay pennies to host, and retain ownership


## Motivation

Given that cost and ownership are my requirements, I tried various tools like VueJs and React but these frameworks have a learning curve which will
require time to learn. My usecase is simple and that time and effort to learn this framework wasn't worth at this time. That is how I stumbled up
Hugo and Github Pages to help me solve my issue.

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is static site generator built in Go that allows users to build a website using free templates

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/‚àè) is a website that you can host from a public github repository


With Hugo, I can use public availale themes and markdown to write techincal blog posts. Github Pages will be the what will host my website from a github repository.
Deployment can be handled by public Github Actions Runner and Workflows to deploy to production.


# Steps

Here are the steps I took to setup [https://darrylbalderas.github.io/](https://darrylbalderas.github.io/)

1. Follow steps on [Github Pages setup guide](https://pages.github.com/)
1. Follow steps on [Hugo's quick start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) I was able to create a simple page
    * You will need to force create since this folder should exist locally already `hugo new site darrylbalderas.github.io --force`
2. Clone [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/tree/main) and use that as your theme. Follow these [instructions](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/blob/main/README.md#quick-start)
3. Edit `hugo.yaml` or `hugo.toml` with the necessary `hugo-coder` theme [configs](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/blob/main/docs/configurations.md)
4. Create a new post `hugo new content posts/post_1.md`
4. Follow the tutorial on [hugo's github actions workflow  deployment](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)
5. Commit code to source control
6. Let Github Actions deploy your website


# Learnings

These are the follow questions that I answered for myself by creating a website with hugo and github pages;

- What are static site generators ?
- What are github actions ?
- What is source control ?
- What are github runners ?
