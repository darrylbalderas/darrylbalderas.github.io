# Problem Statement

Early this year, my goal was to build a profolio website to share project content to better my technical writing.
Even though a profolio sounds like a good idea, it costs money. There are websites that help you do the same like LinkedIn but 
migrating content is a bit of hassle since it is managed by the owner's of the site. I am looking to create a simple website where 
I can quickly blog, pay pennies, and retain ownership


## Motivation

Given that cost and ownership is what I am trying to solve. I tried various tools like VueJs and React but it had a learning curve that I wasn't willing 
to spend the time on since my usecase is to just write simple tech blog post. That is how I stumbled up Hugo and Github Pages to help me solve that. 

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is static site generator built in Go that allows users to build a website using free templates

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/‚àè) is a website that you can host from a public github repository


With Hugo, I can use public availale themes and markdown to write techincal blog posts. Github Pages will be the what will host my website from a github repository.
Deployment can be handled by public Github Actions Runner and Workflows to deploy to production. 


# Steps

Here are the steps I took to setup [https://darrylbalderas.github.io/](https://darrylbalderas.github.io/)

1. Follow steps on [Github Pages setup guide](https://pages.github.com/)
1. Follow steps on [Hugo's quick start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) I was able to create a simple page
    * You will need to force create since this folder should exist locally `hugo new site darrylbalderas.github.io --force`
2. Clone [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/tree/main) and use that as your theme. Follow these [instructions](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/blob/main/README.md#quick-start)
3. Edit `hugo.yaml` or `hugo.toml` with the necessary `hugo-coder` theme [configs](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/blob/main/docs/configurations.md)
4. Create a new post `hugo new content posts/post_1.md`
4. Follow the tutorial on [hugo's github actions workflow  deployment](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)
5. Commit code
6. Watch Github Actions deploy your website
