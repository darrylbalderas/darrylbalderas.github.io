# Problem statement

In my career as a software engineer, I see tooling and programming languages that are making a real impact across the tech industry.
Golang is one of those tools and programming languages I constantly hear about. I like how it improves developer productivity by the simplistic nature of Python and the performance qualities of C++. Improving my developer productivity is an area that I would like to work on more this year.


# Motivation
To improve my developer productivity, I will embark on a journey to improve my Golang skills to build tooling and applications that can scale and are cross-platform, like
[kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [cilium](https://cilium.io/), [argo-workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/), [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and the list goes on and on. Areas that I would like to focus on are;

- [Kubernetes operators](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/)
- [CLIs](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
- [Configuration management](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
- [GRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/basics/) or [HTTP](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) apis


# Plan of attack

For me to learn something, I have to do it. Here are some ways that I plan to improve my Golang skills
- Teach
- Read
- Do projects

Teaching: I will do this by publishing small, digestible articles. That will keep me from doing scope creep when working on projects.

Resources that I plan on reading
- *Distributed Services with Go* **by Travis Jeffery**
- *Powerful Command-Line Applications in Go* **by Travis Jeffery**
- *Learning Go, 2nd Edition* **by Jon Bodner**

Projects that I have in mind;
- Build a custom Kubernetes operator for bootstrapping GitHub webhook on Kubernetes
- Build a custom Kubernetes operator for doing basic chaos testing based SBT (Scenario Based Testing)
- Create a simple CLI tool to generate ready-to-go GRPC and HTTP service templates
- Create an HTTP/GRPC server to serve budget/expense data from a CSV file

# Foreshadowing


If my [approach](#plan-of-attack) goes according to plan, then I will certainly live up to this gif
