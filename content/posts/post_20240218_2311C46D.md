# Problem statement

A batch of hot, crispy cookies and a cold glass of milk is a pound-for-pound undisputed snack champion. Making this type of comment deserves
its explanation on why that is my stance, but that is not the topic of this post. I want to talk about what Cookiecutter is and my uses for using Cookiecutter for my projects.

My main issue with getting started on a project is that I have to start every project from scratch and not leverage project tooling or libraries from previous projects that I can pass along to my future projects.

This issue is solved with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter), which is a cross-platform command-line utility that creates projects from cookiecutters (project templates).

# Steps


1. Install [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)  e.g. `brew install pipx`

1. Install cookiecutter with pipx e.g. `pipx install cookiecutter`

1. Verify you have cookiecutter installed `pipx run cookiecutter --version`

    ```
    $: pipx run cookiecutter --version
    Cookiecutter 2.5.0
    ```

1. Clone golang api cookie cutter template `git clone https://github.com/darrylbalderas/cookiecutter-golang-api`

1. Run cookiecutter to generate api folder `pipx run cookiecutter cookiecutter-golang-api/`

    ```
    $: pipx run cookiecutter cookiecutter-golang-api/
    [1/4] project_name (): api
    [2/4] project_slug (api):
    [3/4] version (0.0.1):
    [4/4] golang_version (1.21):
    ```

1. Change directory generated cookiecutter template `cd api`

1. Execute makefile step Build docker image `make build`

    ```
    $: make build

1. Execute makefile step to start server `make run`

    ```
    $: make run
    2024/02/19 00:22:52 Server is running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
    ```

1. In a different terminal window you can execute curl, to verify api server is running and responding
    ```
    $: curl http://0.0.0.0:8000
    {"message":"Hello world"}%
    ```



Just like that you have an api. Never underestimate the power of cookies. I did not get sponsored by Santa Claus to say that ðŸ˜‰
