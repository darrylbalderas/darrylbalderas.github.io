# Motivation

What is backstage ? [Backstage](https://backstage.spotify.com/) is an open source framework for building developer portals.
As a cloud or platform engineer, Backstage is helpful for providing a frontend stack where an engineer could add custom plugins to allow users
to create or managed their resources across different environments.

My motivation for this post is to showcase on why Backstage is a tool that platform engineers should consider.

In this post we will be discussing the following
- How to run locally
- How to setup Database and AWS connection
- How to install a custom app package
- Create a software template that use newly installed app package



# Steps

I have a [repo](https://github.com/darrylbalderas/demo-backstage) where I have gone through the steps above plus a couple of other things that will not be mentioned in this post like
- Sync catalog items from AWS S3 bucket
- Create new catlog resource and store into AWS S3 bucket
- Setup Github Sign-in to your backstage application


1. Run locally
    1. Read the [pre-reqs](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/#prerequisites)
    2. Create a new backstage app with this command `npx @backstage/create-app@latest`
    3. Change directory and install dependencies `cd my-backstage-app & yarn install`
    4. Start backstage app `yarn dev`

2. Configure postgress database
    1. Ensure you have `docker` install `docker version`
    2. Ensure you have `docker-compose` installed `docker-compose version`
    3. Copy this [`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/darrylbalderas/demo-backstage/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml) file to define a postgres DB e.g.
    ```yaml
        version: '3'

        services:
        postgres:
            image: postgres:latest
            container_name: postgres
            ports:
            - "5432:5432"
            environment:
            POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase
            POSTGRES_USER: postgres
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
            volumes:
            - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

        volumes:
        postgres_data:
    ```
    4. Start postgres DB as a daemon process `docker-compose up -d`
    5. In your `backstage-app/app-config.yaml` update [database section](https://github.com/darrylbalderas/demo-backstage/blob/main/app-config.yaml#L30-L36) to point to the values for databse e.g.
    ```yaml
        database:
            client: pg
            connection:
            host: ${POSTGRES_HOST}
            port: ${POSTGRES_PORT}
            user: ${POSTGRES_USER}
            password: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
    ```
    6. Start your backstage-app to finalize postgres db connection
    7. More information can be found in backstage database [documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/config/database)

3. Configure AWS connection
    1. If have an aws account, you can skip creating a new account. Follow aws documentation to create a new account if you do not have one https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account
    2. Create a separate [iam user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) from your root user for backstage purpose.
    3. After you have the access id and key for your user, you can [update](https://github.com/darrylbalderas/demo-backstage/blob/main/app-config.yaml#L51-L53) your [`backstage-app/app-config.yaml`](https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/aws-s3/locations#configuration) e.g.
    ```yaml
        integrations:
            awsS3:
                - accessKeyId: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
                secretAccessKey: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
    ```
    4. After setup is complete, if your app is running changes will get picked.

4. Install frontend package to dynamic field generation in software template
    1. We will be using this [package]( https://www.npmjs.com/package/@roadiehq/plugin-scaffolder-frontend-module-http-request-field) provided from roadie-hq to grab fields from our external api
    2. Change directory to our frontend package `cd backstage-app/packages/app & yarn add @roadiehq/plugin-scaffolder-frontend-module-http-request-field`
    3. Follow the package [instructions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@roadiehq/plugin-scaffolder-frontend-module-http-request-field) additional setup

5. Create simple [resource golang api](https://github.com/darrylbalderas/demo-backstage/tree/main/backstage-infra/apis/resources) to used in dyanmic fields in our sofware templates
    1. Change directory to resource golang api directory `cd backstage-infra/apis/resource`
    2. Start server in a different terminal `make run`

5. Create custom software template that uses resource golang for dynamic fields. Here is an [example](https://github.com/darrylbalderas/demo-backstage/blob/main/backstage-infra/catalog/scaffold-template-dynamic-field/template.yaml)
    1. Read backstage [documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/writing-templates) for guidance on software template
    2. Follow dynamic field package on how to use it in [software templates ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@roadiehq/plugin-scaffolder-frontend-module-http-request-field)
    3. Once you have created software template, make sure to register it in your `backstage-app/app-config.yaml`. Here is an [example](https://github.com/darrylbalderas/demo-backstage/blob/main/app-config.yaml#L121-L124)
    4. Once you have created and registered your software template, then you can start your backstage app  to test it out `yarn dev`. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/create/templates/default/<name of your template>`

6. Pat yourself on your back for making this far and dealing with the steps above that may or may not have made sense. I tried at least.

# Learnings

Takeways from Backstage is that as a platform engineer, you get into a mindset of how can I surface more information to our users so that they can make better inform descision. We start to enter into interface and custom plugin land where if folks need certain functionality, we could just introduce new APIs.

Things I am interested in learning more
- Metrics
- Catalog discovery
- Load testing when we introduce plugins and store more resources into backstage
