## Motivation

Looking to consolidate my blog projects into a single [repository](https://github.com/darrylbalderas/blog-projects?tab=readme-ov-file) for easier code and dependency management. Mostly taking the approach on
how I am managing the repository that is hosting this blog. Single repo handling all of the blog posts.

## Management

### Tools

* Precommit
* Github actions
* Linters
* Static code analysis
* Configuration

## Learnings

TBD
